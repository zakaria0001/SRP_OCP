## Introduction

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This project focuses on creating flexible, extensible code by utilizing design patterns to achieve the OCP.

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) emphasizes that a class should have only one reason to change. By adhering to SRP, we ensure that our classes are easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Design Patterns

The project incorporates various design patterns to achieve OCP and SRP:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Demonstrates how to encapsulate interchangeable behaviors and allow clients to choose an appropriate strategy at runtime.

- **Decorator Pattern**: Illustrates how to add responsibilities to objects dynamically, providing a flexible way to extend functionality.

- **Factory Method Pattern**: Exhibits the creation of objects through a common interface, enabling easy extension of object creation logic.

- **Observer Pattern**: Demonstrates how to implement a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing multiple observers to be notified of state changes.

- **Command Pattern**: Highlights how to encapsulate requests as objects, enabling parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Java and a development environment set up on your machine. You can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SRP_OCP.git
## Usage
This project serves as an educational resource for understanding how to apply design patterns in Java while adhering to the Open-Closed Principle and Single Responsibility Principle. You can explore the code examples to learn how to implement and utilize these patterns effectively.
